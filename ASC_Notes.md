Hereâ€™s a **concise summary** and **important points** for your MCQ exam on **Basic Models of Artificial Neural Networks** focusing on *Single-layer Feed-Forward Networks* and related concepts:

---

### âœ… **Key Concepts:**

#### ðŸ”¹ **Single-layer Feed-forward Network:**
- Input is passed forward **in one direction** through the network.
- Consists of an **input layer** and an **output layer** (no hidden layers).
- **Each input neuron connects to all output neurons** via weighted links.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Input Layer:**
- **Receives raw data** like images, text, or numbers.
- Performs **data formatting** (e.g., normalization, flattening).
- **Passive**: No activation function or computation.
- **No trainable parameters** (weights/biases).

#### ðŸ”¹ **Weights:**
- Represent the **importance of each input**.
- Large weights = more influence on the output.
- **Learned and adjusted** during training via **backpropagation** to reduce the **loss function**.

---

### âœ… **Network Architectures:**

#### ðŸ”¹ **Multilayer Feed-forward Network:**
- **Input Layer** â†’ **Hidden Layer(s)** â†’ **Output Layer**.
- **Hidden layers**: Internal computation, not exposed externally.
- More hidden layers = More complex, possibly more efficient.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Fully Connected Network:**
- Every neuron in one layer is connected to **every neuron** in the next layer.

### âœ… **Feedback and Recurrent Networks:**

#### ðŸ”¹ **Feed-forward vs. Feedback:**
- **Feed-forward**: No cycles or loops.
- **Feedback**: Output is looped back as input to same/previous layers.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Types of Feedback:**
- **Lateral Feedback**: Output directed back to same-layer neurons.
- **Recurrent Networks**:
  - Include loops â†’ **Retain information over time**.
  - Ideal for **sequential data** (e.g., time series, NLP).
  - Used in **speech recognition, language modeling**.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Single-layer Recurrent Network:**
- One layer with **feedback to itself** or others.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Multilayer Recurrent Network:**
- Feedback can go:
  - From **one layer to previous layers**,
  - Or **within the same layer**.

---

### âœ… **Competitive Learning & Maxnet:**

#### ðŸ”¹ **Maxnet:**
- Used for **Winner-Take-All (WTA)** selection.
- Each neuron:
  - **Excites itself**.
  - **Inhibits others** using a small negative weight (âˆ’Îµ).
- Repeated iterations â†’ Only the **strongest neuron survives**.
- Used in applications requiring **dominant choice selection**.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **Quick MCQ Points Recap:**
- Input layer: No computation, no weights, just data input.
- Feed-forward = No cycles; Feedback = Cycles exist.
- More hidden layers â†’ More complexity.
- Weights determine feature importance.
- Recurrent networks â†’ Work on sequential/time-based data.
- Maxnet â†’ Used in competitive learning to pick strongest neuron.
